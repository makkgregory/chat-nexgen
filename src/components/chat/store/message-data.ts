Hereâ€™s a short original story for you:

---

In a quiet coastal town, there was a lighthouse that hadnâ€™t been lit in years. The townsfolk said it was no longer neededâ€”ships had GPS now, and the old glass lens was cracked anyway. But every evening, a boy named Milo climbed its spiral stairs, carrying a notebook and pencil.

He didnâ€™t care about ships. He cared about stories.

The lighthouse was his secret library. On the top floor, beneath the dusty lantern, the walls were covered with carvingsâ€”dates, names, and scraps of tales sailors had etched during storms while waiting for dawn. Milo copied them down, line by line, piecing together the fragments into adventures that spanned centuries.

One night, during a storm, Milo noticed something strange. The carvings werenâ€™t static anymore. Letters shifted, words rearranged, as if the sailors of the past were whispering new endings into his notebook. He wrote furiously, keeping pace with the glowing letters in the stone.

When the storm cleared, he looked out the broken glass and saw a ship in the distance. Its mast was cracked, sails tornâ€”but it had followed the light. The lighthouse was glowing again, not with fire, but with the words themselves, spilling into the night sky.

From then on, whenever storms rose, Milo returned to the tower, his stories lighting the way. The townsfolk never fixed the lens, and the sea didnâ€™t need it. The ships followed something brighter: the stories of all who had ever passed through, kept alive by one boy who refused to stop writing.

Do you want me to make the next story **short and whimsical**, like a bedtime tale, or **longer and deeper**, like a novella opening?
